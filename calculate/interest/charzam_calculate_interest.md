# InfoHub Tools Checksum

Here you can generate interests

# Introduction

With this tool you can generate interests from [InfoHub Checksum](plugin,charzam_interest).  
There are different kinds of interests. Check the link above to read more about them.  
This graphical user interface (GUI) show a text box where you enter the data, a list with nodes (client / server), a
dropdown where you select the interest method, and a submit button.  
The interest will display under that.

# Nodes

The plugin charzam_interest that does all the work, it comes in a version for the server node and one version for the
client node. Some interest methods are the same, so you can verify your interest between the nodes. Some interest
methods only exist in one of the nodes due to practical reasons.  
The server node are written in PHP. PHP has many more interests built in. The client node are written in Javascript,
here are nothing built in and all interest functions have to be written.
